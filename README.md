# Collatz Conjecture Implementation

This repository contains a Python program that implements the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture. The program reads a non-negative and non-zero integer number from the user and then performs operations based on whether the number is even or odd until the number becomes 1. The program also counts the number of steps it takes to reach 1 from the initial number.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program.
3. Run the program using Python 3.
